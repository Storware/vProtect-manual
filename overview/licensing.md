# Licensing

We offer several licensing options, which allows you to choose the best fit for your use case.

**Note:** Licensing options cannot be mixed within a single environment.

## Types

### Per Host

This license type covers the number of physical hosts under the virtualization technology. With per-host licensing you can have an unlimited number of VMs or TBs. In case you have machines with more sockets than 2, then you need one host license per every two sockets. This is the most commonly chosen option, as future host growth is more predictable, and you do not need to take care of dynamically changing number of VMs or used TBs.

### Per VM

This license type covers the exact number of virtual machines that you want to protect. You can have any number of hosts or TBs. This option is a good fit for MSPs, to align with your managed VM services pricing.

### Per TB

Here we would like to meet requirements to align with front-end TB licensing. By 1TB steps, the only size of your storage being backed up matters. You can have as many hosts or VMs as you want. In some cases, this is the most effective licensing especially for smaller numbers of TBs.

### Per Compute Node

Here we come with a special option for our [Kubernetes](../deployment/protected-platforms/containers/kubernetes.md) or [Red Hat OpenShift](../deployment/protected-platforms/containers/red-hat-openshift.md) containerization platforms.
