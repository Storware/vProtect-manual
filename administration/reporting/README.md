# Reporting

Reporting features allow users to view statistics especially for backup and restore tasks. It gives also the possibility to view what happened lately in the vProtect environment.

Reporting is separated into three divisions:

* Virtual Environment - for general statistics about data for virtual machines
* Applications - for general statistics about data for applications
* Storage Providers - for general statistics about data
* Audit logs - for important events in terms of security and system administration.

Detailed information on these individual sections can be found directly in the related articles.
