# Storage Providers

vProtect introduces a new type of backup source - storage provider. Now you can protect Ceph RBD volumes, plain file systems, and Nutanix Files \(AFS\) as a technical preview.

You can execute full and incremental backups, recover individual files using mounted backups or share them over iSCSI.
